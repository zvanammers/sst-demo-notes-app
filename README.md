# SST Notes App

This is a simple static site built to practice setting up a front end project, setting up CI/CD pipeline.

This app connects to a weather API.

I used SST to develop the AWS resources, and for local development.

Currently hosted at https://d1jrqg0cz9i57u.cloudfront.net.

## How to spin up the app for local dev

1. Configure aws login `aws configure sso`

2. Run `pnpm dev` in notes folder

3. Run `pnpm run dev:frontend:sst` in notes folder
